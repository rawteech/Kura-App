# Kura-App
This is just a simple poll application I created using django, for practice purposes. 

## Running the App
1. Just clone the repo
2. Make sure you have Django 1.10.* installed and Python 3.4 or above
3. Run the app
4. Don't forget to run the migrations, also delete the ```db.sqlite3``` file, you won't need it
5. Happy Coding :trollface:
